# ElectricVehicle
Electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles offer reduced operating costs, fuel savings, and environmental benefits.
I would like to share about the internship I have done at Feynn Labs and AIncubator - Feynn Labs under the guidance of Sanjay Basumatary. During this internship period, I along with my team members have done the Market Segmentation Analysis of Electric Vehicles In India using Segmentation analysis and machine learning algorithms.
Techniques and Algorithms used: Machine learning using Python with numpy and pandas, PCA, k means clustering.

In this project, we collected different datasets and analyzed the customer's purchase behaviors, and using different clustering algorithms, we did customer segmentation.

Result: Segmentation analysis is an important step before we embark on a marketing plan. Hence it is important to learn how to analyze our audience and market. By analyzing the trend we observe that India's Electric Vehicles Market is showing immense potential and attracting huge investors. In this project, we found that Maharastra and Uttar Pradesh have the highest target consumers. In this project, we also analyzed the competitor ev dataset in order to find which factor we need to focus on more. We found that Price, Range, Full charge time, and profession of the consumer are important keys to consumers' purchase decisions.

With this, I have successfully completed the internship as a Machine Learning Intern at Feynn Labs, Feynn Labs Consultancy Services, and AIncubator - Feynn Labs. I would like to thank our guide Sanjay Basumatary for this amazing opportunity.
